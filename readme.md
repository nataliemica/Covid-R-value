# *Rough* estimation of R-value for Covid-19
### Data taken from [Public Health Scotland](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-in-scotland) 

## About this project
Estimating the R-value for any disease spread is numerically intensive and complex. Here I just wanted to simply try my hand at analysing and fitting real data with simple equations. 

All fitting was done on the cummulative Covid-19 infections for Scotland.
